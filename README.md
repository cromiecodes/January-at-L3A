# L3A
    Introduction
The internet has brought both unprecedented connectivity and a new culture to our world 🌍 . 

Someone in the 90s would not have been able to imagine that streaming a video 📹 from their bedroom could generate more income than that of a doctor 👨‍⚕️. 

Fast forward to today’s age, some YouTubers have more influence than politicians. 

In the hyper-connected world today, if you get beaten by a police 🚔 officer on the street and someone records and streams it, it's no longer just a local police department disciplinary issue; it can lead to a diplomatic crisis between nations. 

The internet has changed the world for the better...

... Well... for the most part. 

You see 👀

It also comes with a price 💰. 

Even though big Web 2.0 players may have ethical and moral codes, they still control who sees what, when, and why. Companies like Facebook and Google are the world's most powerful companies because, within the last 3 years, data has surpassed oil in value. 

    “The world’s most valuable resource 
    is no longer oil, but data.” -economist.com

These big companies have authority and influence over the world’s data and information, and we are expected to trust 🔒 them. Their advertising-based business models, personalized ads, represent over 60% of internet-generated revenue. Their “proprietary” algorithms are specifically designed to increase engagement regardless of its impact on their users.

    Data is centralized.

Today, large data players like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft control over 85% of  Internet data. That is more than 100 zettabytes and growing exponentially 📈.

Selling our attention, prediction of our future behavior, actions, and perception to advertisers for profit is the bottom line. We are the product and the puppets of algorithms.

Information asymmetry has demonstrated social inequality ⚖️, scandals, polarization, and corruption have even sometimes led to war. 

With an enormous amount of concentrated data and information, surveillance capitalism has come to shape politics and culture. Sadly, the more power you have, the more information you can gain, leading to an advantage for only a few individuals, entities, and societies. Sure some say that’s how the world works. 

Maybe 🤔. 

But we have come a long way from kings & pharaohs. Today, most have access to information, thanks to the internet, which was only available for presidents 🥇 or VIPs in the 60s.

The next generation of the web-

    Web 3.0 is here. 

It is early and estimated to be more complex and impactful than Web 2.0. 

The current web is centered around the “sharing of information.

    Web 3.0 is extending this to “share of information + value.” 

It will introduce more advanced industries than the current Web 2.0. 

Imagine the futuristic 👽 business applications we have yet to discover.Building a petabyte-scale decentralized, immutable data infrastructure.

    The next generation of the web (Web 3.0) is far more complicated and powerful. 

We should not underestimate the power and the core principles of decentralization. 

Distributed ledger technologies (DLT), smart contracts, scalable public blockchains 🧱, and movements toward decentralization will play a crucial role in the next 10-20 years of the internet.


With the use of cryptographic principles, distributed ledger technologies, and modern decentralized data architecture (data mesh), we have an opportunity and a small window of time to create a New Era of data infrastructure standards for Web 3.0 🌐. 

Instead of putting all trust and faith in corporations and the people behind running them, we should embrace Open Data Protocols & Infrastructures with built-in trust, security, transparency, and traceability by design ✍️. 

The data should be immutable, and governance of the Protocol, management, and development execution of the roadmap should not have a single authority. 

Building Open Data Protocols and Infrastructures will not only open doors for new industries and exponential growth in web3, but it will also help to legitimize the industry ✅. 

    L3A believes in access to quality, unedited information, as a fundamental right. 

A right that you should NOT have to pay for!

    What type of data does L3Atom store and cover?

L3A stores all transactional data in Web 3.0.

    Data Sources
L3A stores data from the following data sources

    Decentralized Finance
All financial transactions including wallets, assets, liquidity, value locked, asset transfers, asset custody

    Decentralized Crypto Exchanges
All financial transaction, liquidity, assets, asset transfers, wallets

    Centralized Crypto Exchanges
Order books, trade data, transactional data, candle stick, ticker, inflow and outflow data

    Blockchain Games
Games, user assets, user activities, game asset classifications, game assets transfers, in-game transactions

    Metaverses
Metaverse assets, transactions, user activities

    Oracles
All oracle transactions

    Public Blockchains
Block size, block events, asset transfers, wallet addresses, blockchain confirmations, smart contract events

    Why should you care?
Technologies no longer double ✖️2️⃣ every decade. 

In the world of Web 3.0, some technology adoption cycles 🔂 are completed in less than 18 months.

If the semantic web is inevitable and far more complex than the current web, we all have a responsibility to pay attention to how Web 3.0 data will be governed 👩‍⚖️ and used. 

We should do our best to introduce appropriate standards, protocol design, and principles to establish a good foundation for the future of web3 data. 

In the Web 2.0 era, innovators had amazing opportunities to invent “what is a database” and “how a web page should rank.” I believe we all have the same opportunity and responsibility today to invent, define, question, and build 👷‍♂️ better technologies.

Access to information has improved societies for centuries. We all should acknowledge and do better. 

    “Access to truthful, unedited information is a fundamental right
Free, Open-Source Data 4 Everyone 🌍

    What is L3A?
L3A is a petabyte-scale Open Data Initiative for crypto  and Web 3.0, allowing everyone to have access to quality immutable data for free 🆓, forever. Our mission is to address the information asymmetry in Web 3.0 by democratizing data. 

L3A Protocol is designed to collect, cryptographically store, process, and stream data for free to anyone from anywhere. It stores billions of the world’s crypto and Web 3.0 data points 📍, transactions 🧾, and historical records 💾 allowing anyone to access data without having any intervention, interference, or influence over regulations, governments, and corporations, including the creators themselves

    How L3Atom works
L3A Protocol, by design 🎨, has no single authority that can alter its data, how the information is distributed or controlled, or who can see what and when. The infrastructure is open-source and governed by an open-source community.

Unlike traditional monolithic data infrastructures that handle the consumption, storage, transformation 🆕, and output of data in one central data lake 🐟 and controlled by a small group of people, L3A’s self-serve design and data mesh architecture supports distributed, domain-specific data consumers and views “data-as-a-product,” with each domain handling their own data pipelines.

When a user is provisioning a node, it installs the core systems, low-level communications, and applications required to collect and process 🔃 data onto the compute node and then adds the compute node to the cluster. The self-serve design allows users to reduce technical complexities making users able to focus on their individual data use cases. 

This architecture allows greater autonomy and flexibility for end users and data owners, facilitating greater data experimentation 🔬 and innovation.

The current L3A Infrastructure (v4) covers approximately 80% of the entire crypto and Web 3.0 transactions today. 

We are collecting between 0.8-2.5 terabytes of data per day, and we estimate that we will soon reach the petabyte scale ⚖️.

    Core Functionalities of v4

    Live Web 3.0 data streaming service
End users can subscribe to live data feeds for free 🆓, i.e., Coinbase BTC/USD feed.


    Historical data-as-a-service
End users can use APIs or GraphQL to request historical transactions 🏦. i.e., All BTC/USD trade data on Coinbase between 10-10-2019 to 01-02-2020.


    Analytical & query service
Users can query, combine and run analytics on data via a web-based open analytical application. Users can create, test, visualize, and deploy custom data feeds 📊 and develop data products and gain insights at scale. 

    Example: Net inflow of USDT on Uniswap compared to Binance in the last 26 minutes.

Our goal is to be able to plug 🔌 the query engine directly into smart 📲 contracts to introduce on-chain analytics, enabling a data-driven web3 industry. 

We envision a thriving ecosystem ♻️ of researchers, data scientists 🧑‍🔬, entrepreneurs 👨‍💼, quants, traders, financial engineers 🦾, protocol architects 🏛️, startups, lawyers 👩🏼‍💼, regulators 👨‍⚖️, and even the general public 🏘️ to use L3Atom's Open Data infrastructure to innovate, develop various data applications, run analytics, search and indexing, hybrid oracles, trading, risk management, Web3 🌐 BI, financial engineering and financial forensics, etc.

## Background
This repository will dive deeper into what I have learned during my first month at L3A Protocol. Each section represents a step in the process to my current knowledgebase.
